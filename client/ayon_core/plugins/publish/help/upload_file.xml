## {upload_type} upload failed after retries

The connection to the AYON server timed out while uploading a file.

### How to resolve?

1. Try publishing again. Intermittent network hiccups often resolve on retry.
2. Ensure your network/VPN is stable and large uploads are allowed.
3. If it keeps failing, try again later or contact your admin.
