class HostBase(ABC):
    """Base of host implementation class.

    Host is pipeline implementation of DCC application. This class should help
    to identify what must/should/can be implemented for specific functionality.

    Compared to 'avalon' concept:
    What was before considered as functions in host implementation folder. The
    host implementation should primarily care about adding ability of creation
    (mark products to be published) and optionally about referencing published
    representations as containers.

    Host may need extend some functionality like working with workfiles
    or loading. Not all host implementations may allow that for those purposes
    can be logic extended with implementing functions for the purpose. There
    are prepared interfaces to be able identify what must be implemented to
    be able use that functionality.
    - current statement is that it is not required to inherit from interfaces
        but all of the methods are validated (only their existence!)

    # Installation of host before (avalon concept):
    ```python
    from ayon_core.pipeline import install_host
    import ayon_core.hosts.maya.api as host

    install_host(host)
    ```

    # Installation of host now:
    ```python
    from ayon_core.pipeline import install_host
    from ayon_core.hosts.maya.api import MayaHost

    host = MayaHost()
    install_host(host)
    ```

    Todo:
        - move content of 'install_host' as method of this class
            - register host object
            - install global plugin paths
        - store registered plugin paths to this object
        - handle current context (project, asset, task)
            - this must be done in many separated steps
        - have it's object of host tools instead of using globals

    This implementation will probably change over time when more
        functionality and responsibility will be added.
